// todo physics-simulator chemistry engine:
//  there is components like water, flour, eggs, sugar, powdered sugar, fruits, fruit juice
//  we have a mixing degree
//  depending on mixing degree and components, there is different states:
//   - powder
//   - fluid
//   - dough
//   - solid
//  and they mix in 3D,
//  and the user works with them, mixes them, etc.
//  and there is containers for them
//  and we have a classifier for what something is
//  and ofc there is cooking recipes for the user to follow,
//  and baking/heating stations/places,
//  and we calculate calories, far percentage etc
//  and we combine it with Bullet physics

// todo we need recipe mixing...
//  upto four components per particle???
//  mix color/physics separate from components???

// todo first-person player
// todo player can grab stuff
// todo player can throw things, let them fall
// todo player is in a relatively simple environment
